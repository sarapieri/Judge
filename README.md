### Cost Estimator

Note: Currently supports only GPT-4V, could be extended to other APIs.  

Functionality:
Processes a dataset of images and text prompts, calculating the cost based on token usage
for both high and low detail image processing. Outputs cost statistics to the console. No calls to OpenAI are submitted. 

Command Line Arguments:
--model_name: Specifies the name of the model to be used for encoding text into tokens. The default model used is "gpt-4". This parameter allows the script to adapt to different models compatible with the tiktoken encoding tool.
--prompt_file: Sets the path to the file containing the prompt text that will be used in the token calculation. 
--data_file: Defines the path to the JSON dataset file that contains the dataset to be processed. 
--cost_per_token_input: Specifies the cost per input token when calculating the total cost of processing. This cost should align with the current pricing model which can be checked at OpenAI Pricing.
--cost_per_token_output: Determines the cost per output token, used in the cost computation similarly to the input token cost. This cost should align with the current pricing also based on the pricing information provided by OpenAI at the same pricing link above.
--possible_output_text: Provides a string that represents hypothetical output text to be used for estimating output token count. This text is used to simulate the number of output tokens that might be generated in response to the processed input data. By default, currently this is an empty string, which implies no output tokens are assumed unless specified.

Each of these arguments can be customized as needed when running the script from the command line. 

You can run it with: 

cd Judge
python cost_estimate.py

Which will result in running it with the custom parameters (which can be modified): 

python cost_estimate.py --model_name gpt-4 --prompt_file ./prompt_gpt-4_V1.txt --data_file ./dataset.json --cost_per_token_input 0.00001 --cost_per_token_output 0.00003 --possible_output_text ''

Possible output: 

--------------------------------

Average Tokens (Low Detail per Image): 85.00
Input Token Count (Low Detail) One sample: 448
Input Token Count (High Detail) One Sample: 1128
Total Output Tokens: 0, Per sample: 0.0
Total Cost for High Detail: $77.74 (Average per Image: $0.0152)
Total Cost for Low Detail: $23.74 (Average per Image: $0.0046)

### GPT-4V_eval

Note: Currently supports only GPT-4V, could be extended to other APIs or open-source models. 

Functionality:
This Python script is designed to process a dataset consisting of images and texts by interacting with the OpenAI API, specifically leveraging the capabilities of the GPT-4 Vision model. The script accepts various parameters to customize the operation according to user needs.

Command Line Arguments:
--model_choice: Specify the model for OpenAI requests. Default is gpt-4-vision-preview.
--image_quality: Set the image processing quality to either 'low' or 'high' needed for OpenAI. Default is 'low'.
--openai_api_key: Required API key for making requests to OpenAI.
--data_file: File path to the JSON file containing the dataset. 
--prompt_file: File path to the text file containing prompt data. 
--output_file: Output file path for saving the JSON file with predictions. 
--save_every: Frequency of saving data to the output file, measured in iteration cycles. 
--start_index and --end_index: Define the subset of the dataset to process by specifying start and end indices.
--debug: Toggle debugging mode to receive more detailed logs during execution.

Each of these arguments can be customized as needed when running the script from the command line. 

You can run it with: 

cd Judge
python GPT-4V_eval.py --openai_api_key "your key" 

Which will result in running it with the custom parameters (which can be modified): 

python GPT-4V_eval.py \
    --model_choice gpt-4-vision-preview --image_quality low --openai_api_key "your key"  \
    --data_file ./dataset.json \
    --prompt_file ./prompt_gpt-4_V1.txt \
    --output_file gpt-4-vision-predictions.json \
    --save_every 1 \
    --start_index 0 \
    --end_index 2 \
    --debug False \

Possible output: 

Json file:

    {
        "id": "VLGuard_train_1",
        "image": "VLGuard/train/bad_ads/39cce764-2241-4b2e-bb5e-f762cfa3d097.png",

        "pred_safe_in_combination": false
    }
    ...
